        <h2>Tropical Climate</h2>
        <p>Tropical climates are characterized by consistent high temperatures (usually above 18°C or 64°F) throughout the year and significant precipitation. These climates are typically found near the equator, between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.</p>
        <p>Tropical climates are vital to the Earth's overall climate system and biodiversity, playing a crucial role in carbon sequestration and oxygen production.</p>

        <h2>Temperate Climate</h2>
        <p>Temperate climates are characterized by moderate temperatures that typically fluctuate between the extremes of hot and cold. These climates are generally found in the middle latitudes, between the tropics and the polar regions. The temperate climate zone supports a variety of ecosystems and is often divided into several subtypes based on seasonal temperature patterns and precipitation.</p>
        <p>Temperate climates are conducive to human habitation and agriculture, making them some of the most heavily populated and economically productive areas in the world. The moderate weather conditions and rich biodiversity make these regions crucial for both human societies and natural ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>Polar Climate</h2>
        <p>Polar climates are characterized by extremely cold temperatures and are found in the polar regions of the Earth, including the Arctic and Antarctic. These climates are known for their harsh conditions, with long, frigid winters and short, cool summers.</p>
        <p>Polar climates are essential to the Earth's climate system, acting as global coolers and influencing weather patterns. Despite their harsh conditions, they support unique ecosystems and are critical indicators of environmental changes.</p>
